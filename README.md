# 🏎️ Formula One Team Performance Predictor

**Formula One Team Performance Predictor** is a machine learning project focused on forecasting Formula 1 race results and constructor standings.

By analyzing historical race data, driver performance, and circuit characteristics from the 2021–2024 seasons, the project predicts future race outcomes and overall team performance trends.  
Our goal is to combine real-world motorsport data with powerful ML models to generate accurate insights for the 2025 Formula 1 season.
